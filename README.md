  The purpose of using variables prior to the constructor function is to declare instance variables, also known as properties, that can be accessed and modified by all the methods within the class. These variables are used to store data that needs to be retained throughout the lifespan of the object. The term "instance variables" or "properties" is used to refer to these variables.

2. Is it possible to skip defining variables before the constructor function?
3. Even though variables can be assigned null values, why do we still utilize null safety in Dart?
